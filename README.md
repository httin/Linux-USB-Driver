A usb driver module for testing

## Getting Started
USB devices are quite complex and are made up of lots of different logical units. 
To sum up, the relationships among these units can be simply described as follows:
* Devices usually have one or more configurations.
* Configurations often have one or more interfaces.
* Interfaces usually have one or more settings.
* Interfaces have zero or more endpoints.
